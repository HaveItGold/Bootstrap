This is a website created by Luca Guizar for the Bootstrap & Web Design project in Dr. Jaiclin's 6th period "Applied Computer Science" class.
The website is the website for a fake pizza restaurant and is meant to show coding skills while also giving the viewer a laugh.
I tried to make every element in this website as unique yet entertaining as possible, along with the website idea itself.
There were also elements that were required in the project that need to be stated so here they are.

5 items from list:
  1) Button
  2) Spinner
  3) Alert
  4) Badge
  5) Card
2 open items:
  1) Floating labels
  2) Offcanvas

If there are any requests or suggestions that you would like for me to implement, please let me know and I will greatly appreciate it.
